    "content": "Next.js is an open-source web development framework created by Vercel enabling React-based web applications with server-side rendering and generating static websites.  React documentation mentions Next.js among 'Recommended Toolchains' advising it to developers as a solution when 'Building a server-rendered website with Node.js'.[4] Where traditional React apps can only render their content in the client-side browser, Next.js extends this functionality to include applications rendered on the server-side.  The copyright and trademarks for Next.js are owned by Vercel,[5] which also maintains and leads its open-source development.",
